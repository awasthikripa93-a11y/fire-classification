        "\n",
        "Sometimes, you may want to run Jupyter notebooks on a remote server and access it through a browser on your local computer. If Linux or macOS is installed on your local machine (Windows can also support this function through third-party software such as PuTTY), you can use port forwarding:\n",

        "The above string `myserver` is the address of the remote server.\n",
        "Then we can use http://localhost:8888 to access the remote server `myserver` that runs Jupyter notebooks. We will detail on how to run Jupyter notebooks on AWS instances\n",
        "later in this appendix.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Timing\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the `ExecuteTime` plugin to time the execution of each code cell in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
        "Use the following commands to install the plugin:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n",
        "jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n",
        "jupyter nbextension enable execute_time/ExecuteTime\n",

        "\n",
        "High Correlation between brightness and frp: There appears to be a strong positive correlation between 'brightness' and 'frp'. This is expected as both features are related to the intensity of the fire. Higher brightness is likely to be associated with higher fire radiative power. This strong correlation might indicate multicollinearity if both features are used directly in a linear model, but can also be insightful for understanding the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moderate Correlation between brightness and confidence: There seems to be a moderate positive correlation between 'brightness' and 'confidence'. This suggests that brighter fire detections tend to be associated with higher confidence levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moderate Correlation between frp and confidence: Similarly, there is likely a moderate positive correlation between 'frp' and 'confidence'. Fires with higher radiative power might be easier to detect and thus have higher confidence scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low Correlation with Geographical Features: The correlations between 'latitude' and 'longitude' with 'brightness', 'confidence', and 'frp' appear to be relatively low. This suggests that the intensity or confidence of a fire detection is not strongly linearly related to its geographical location. While there might be spatial patterns as seen in the scatter plot, a simple linear correlation doesn't capture them strongly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlation between latitude and longitude: The correlation between 'latitude' and 'longitude' is often low unless there's a specific geographical pattern in the data that aligns linearly. In this case, it's likely low, indicating that fires are distributed across various locations without a strong linear relationship between their latitude and longitude coordinates within the dataset.\n",

        "Overall, the heatmap provides a concise overview of the linear relationships between the numerical features. It highlights the expected strong correlations between features related to fire intensity (brightness, frp, confidence) and shows that geographical coordinates have weaker linear relationships with these intensity measures.

The lower whiskers might also show some outliers on the lower end.\n",
